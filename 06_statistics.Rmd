```{r setup, include=FALSE}

After a great discussion started by Jesse Maegan (@kiersi) on Twitter, I decided to post a workthrough of some (fake) experimental treatment data. These data correspond to a new (fake) research drug called AD-x37, a theoretical drug that has been shown to have beneficial outcomes on cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In the current experiment we will be statistically testing whether the drug was effective in reducing cognitive impairment in dementia patients. See the data HERE.

We will be using MMSE (mini-mental status exam) scores to assess the degree of cognitive impairment. In a real clinical trial, many other variables would be recorded, but for the sake of a straightforward but multi-variate example we will stick to just MMSE.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



```{r}
library(readxl)

# read excel file
raw_df <- read_xlsx("./data/ad_treatment.xlsx")


```


```{r}
glimpse(raw_df)
```
## Age 

```{r}
raw_df %>% 
 summarise(min = min(age), max = max(age))
```
## Age distribution

```{r}
g2 <- ggplot(raw_df, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue")
g2
```

```{r}
# raw_df <- raw_df %>% 
#   mutate(sex = if_else(sex == 0, "Female", "Male"))
```


```{r}
# raw_df %>% 
#   select(drug_treatment , health_status) %>% 
#   table()


raw_df %>% 
  count(drug_treatment, health_status) 
```
## Missing Value

```{r}
raw_df %>% 
  summarize(na_count = sum(is.na(mmse)))
```

```{r}
table(raw_df$drug_treatment, raw_df$health_status)
```
```{r}
table(raw_df$drug_treatment, raw_df$health_status, raw_df$sex)
```
Alternate, way

```{r}
raw_df %>% 
  count(drug_treatment, health_status, sex)
```


## Data exploration of dependent variable

Before running our summary statistics we can actually visualize the range, central tendency and quartiles via a geom_boxplot call.

```{r}

ggplot(data = raw_df, # add the data
       aes(x = drug_treatment, y = mmse, # set x, y coordinates
           color = drug_treatment)) +    # color by treatment
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(~health_status) + # create panes base on health status
  coord_flip()

```
### Summary

```{r}
raw_df %>% 
  glimpse()
```


## Factorize

```{r}
sum_df <- raw_df %>% 
            mutate(
              sex = factor(sex, 
                  labels = c("Male", "Female")),
              drug_treatment =  factor(drug_treatment, 
                  levels = c("Placebo", "Low dose", "High Dose")),
              health_status = factor(health_status, 
                  levels = c("Healthy", "Alzheimer's"))
              )
```

## Calculate

```{r}
sum_df <- sum_df %>%   
  group_by(sex, health_status, drug_treatment) %>%  
  summarize(mmse_mean = mean(mmse),   
            mmse_se = sd(mmse)/sqrt(n()),
            n_samples = n()) %>%
  ungroup() # ungrouping variable is a good habit to prevent errors


sum_df
```

## Save the file to disk

```{r}
write_csv(sum_df, "adx37_sum_stats.csv")



```

## Plotting summary statistics

```{r}
g <- ggplot(data = sum_df, # add the data
       aes(x = drug_treatment,  #set x, y coordinates
           y = mmse_mean,
           group = drug_treatment,  # group by treatment
           color = drug_treatment)) +    # color by treatment
  geom_point(size = 3) + # set size of the dots
  facet_grid(sex~health_status) # create facets by sex and status
g

```


## Statistics

```{r}
# set up the statistics df
stats_df <- raw_df %>% # start with data
   mutate(drug_treatment = factor(drug_treatment, levels = c("Placebo", "Low dose", "High Dose")),
         sex = factor(sex, labels = c("Male", "Female")),
         health_status = factor(health_status, levels = c("Healthy", "Alzheimer's")))

glimpse(stats_df)
```

```{r}
glimpse(sum_df)
```


### ANOVA

```{r eval=F}
# pseudocode example of ANOVA call

aov(dependent_variable ~ independent variable, data = data_df)
```

```{r}
# this gives main effects AND interactions
ad_aov <- aov(mmse ~ sex * drug_treatment * health_status, 
        data = stats_df)


ad_aov
```


```{r}
# this would give ONLY main effects
ad_aov <- aov(mmse ~ sex + drug_treatment + health_status, data = stats_df)

ad_aov
```

```{r}
# look at effects and interactions
summary(ad_aov)


ad_aov
```

```{r}
# this extracts ANOVA output into a nice tidy dataframe
tidy_ad_aov <- tidy(ad_aov)

# which we can save to Excel
write_csv(tidy_ad_aov, "ad_aov.csv")
```


```{r}
# pairwise t.tests
ad_pairwise <- pairwise.t.test(stats_df$mmse,
                               stats_df$sex:stats_df$drug_treatment:stats_df$health_status, 
                               p.adj = "none")
```

```{r}
# look at the posthoc p.values in a tidy dataframe
head(tidy(ad_pairwise))
```

```{r}
# tidy
tidy_ad_pairwise <- tidy(ad_pairwise)

# save to excel
write_csv(tidy_ad_pairwise, "tidy_ad_pairwise.csv")
```

```{r}
# call and tidy the tukey posthoc
tidy(
                      TukeyHSD(ad_aov, 
                              which = 'sex:drug_treatment:health_status')
                      )



TukeyHSD(ad_aov)

tidy(TukeyHSD(ad_aov, 'male:drug_treatment:health_status'))

??TuckeyHSD

summary(ad_aov)

# save to excel
write_csv(tidy_ad_tukey, "tukey_ad.csv")

head(tidy_ad_tukey)
```
